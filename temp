## Configuration


Examples:

    # Set author and title for the document
    author: John Doe
    title: A Presentation on Presentations
    
    # Set the date to be used on the title page (if unset, Beamer will use the current date by default)
    date: 32nd February 2151
    
    # Tell the program to generate a title page
    titlepage: yes
    
    # Set double-asterisk emphasis to colour the text green instead (note Yaml dictionary inside dictionary syntax, as well as the single quotes around strings with special characters)
    emph:
        '**': '\color{green}{{ "{%s" }}}'
    
    # Tell LaTeX to import 2 additional packages, where the second package requires options (note Yaml list syntax)
    packages:
        - mypackage
        - option,otheroption,myotherpackage


To edit the user configuration file use the `-e` (or `--edit`) flag and supply your preferred text editor, e.g.: `beamr -e kate`. On subsequent runs the editor can be ommitted as it will be saved in the configuration (unless you purposefully remove it). You can also dump the entire default configuration at the end of this file to more easily understand how and what can be edited: `beamr -ed`



1. Any other text which does not fall into these categories is ignored (in the future there will be options to add notes to slides and export handouts with those notes separately from the plain slide show).
