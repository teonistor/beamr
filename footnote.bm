This presentation is very interesting[-As I mentioned in my _previous_ presentation-].

This footnote[-24:This one-] has a label, which I can now use to refer to it again[-24:-]. You can even do that across different slides.

If you need a colon in the footnote text you can give it an empty label[-:Meet at 15:30-].

Beamr uses PLY[--plyman] for lexing and parsing.
